## Register Bot Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll register our [Slack Bot Integration](http://slack.com/services/new/bot) and [Wolfram API](http://account.wolfram.com/wolframid) to get our access tokens.

### Slack API

1. Once on the [bot](http://slack.com/services/new/bot) section, type Bot's name and click Add
2. Copy your token and fill out as many fields as you want, altough I recommend to give an avatar and description. Click Save.
3. Once we are on our channel, just click 'Add an app' and select it
